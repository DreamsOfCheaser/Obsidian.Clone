# Self-introduction

### Basic

Hello.

My name is Zhou Xinwei, coming from YiChang, HuBei Province.  I'm 20 years old now, single. I major in Software Engineering in XJTU. 

### Hobby

The reason why I choose SE is that I'm good at programming. Maybe not only programming, I think I'm also interested in all the aspects of computers, like hardware, games and so on. If you have trouble with your computer or you want to have new one, you can ask me for help.  

But if you think I'm a typical man who sits in front of the screen all day and always wears a shirt with the same pattern, then you must be wrong. I love sports, especially the Ultimate Frisbee, the most popular sports among teens. Stand for our school, my teammates and I take the crown in the tournament last year.

### Character

I can always be happy and active, and the people around me tell me like this, too. Compared with the thing I experienced before, I like the unknown more. I can always bring out my best in the fields I'm interested in, but I can't be like that if you ask me to do something I'm bored with.

### Surroundings

I have an excellent family, and many good friends around me. I'm proud of them and maybe they're happy to stay with me. And I believe that I can have a colorful life if I just keep going with them. The day with them  never fails me.

### End

Thatâ€™s all about myself. Thank you!
